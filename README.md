Isabelle, Personal Assistant - BOT (WIP)
===

> **Official bot of:** [Animal Crossing - New Leaf ðŸ‡§ðŸ‡·](http://t.me/acnlbr)

This bot is just a _helping hand_ for those are want to _prof-it_ on some features about **Animal Crossing - New Leaf.**

## How it Works
For now, this bot has just two basic functions...

- Register your Turnips prices
- List them all

The bot will check out automatically what's the day of week,when you tap on **Cadastrar** button, and register your prices on a simple JSON file.

According all users going to registering all the prices, you will be able to check the complete prices list when tap on **Listar** button.

## Work in progress
> - **v1.0a:**
>
>   We're actually working on the 1.0b version. It will run in a SQL Database and will have some new features...
