There some rules that you will need to pay attention:

- You must register your Friend Code before add turnips or fruits info;
- You could register Buy Price only on sundays;
- You will be able to register Turnips Price Sell, based in the real time (limited by day, not in hours).
- The List Turnips menu will show the list based on the period (Monday -  Saturday for Sell Prices and Sunday for Buy Prices )
